<h2>
VNC - How it works</h2>

<h3>
The VNC Protocol</h3>
The VNC protocol is a simple protocol for remote access to graphical user
interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is based on the concept of a <i>remote framebuffer</i>
or<i> RFB</i>. In the past we have tended to refer to the VNC protocol
as the RFB protocol, so you may have seen this term in other publications.&nbsp;
The protocol simply allows a server to update the framebuffer displayed
on a viewer. Because it works at the framebuffer level it is potentially
applicable to all operating systems, windowing systems and applications.
This includes X/Unix, Windows 3.1/95/NT and Macintosh, but might also include
PDAs, and indeed any device with some form of communications link. The
protocol will operate over any reliable transport such as TCP/IP.&nbsp;
<center>
<p><a NAME="38"></a><a NAME="figrfbarch"></a><img SRC="clientserver.gif" ALT="" height=118 width=264 align=BOTTOM></center>

<p>This is truly a "thin-client" protocol: it has been designed to make
very few requirements of the viewer. In this way, clients can run on the
widest range of hardware, and the task of implementing a client is made
as simple as possible.&nbsp;
<h3>
Rectangular updates</h3>
The display side of the protocol is based around a single graphics primitive:
<i>"put
a rectangle of pixel data at a given x,y position"</i>. This might seem
an inefficient way of drawing arbitrary user interface components. But
because we have a variety of different <i>encoding schemes</i> for the
pixel data, we can select the appropriate scheme for each rectangle we
send, and make the most of network bandwidth, client drawing speed and
server processing speed.&nbsp;
<p>The lowest common denominator is the so-called <i>raw</i> encoding,
where the rectangle is simply pixel data sent in left-to-right scanline
order. All clients and servers must support this encoding. However, the
encodings actually used on any given VNC connection can be negotiated according
to the abilities of the server, the client, and the connection between
the two.&nbsp;
<p>The <i>copy rectangle</i> encoding, for example, is very simple and
efficient and can be used when the client already has the same pixel data
elsewhere in its framebuffer. The server simply sends an X,Y coordinate
giving the position&nbsp; from which the client can copy the rectangle
of pixel data. This means that operations such as dragging or scrolling
a window, which involve substantial changes to the screen, may only require
a few bytes. Most clients will support this encoding, since it is generally
simple to implement and saves bandwidth.&nbsp;
<p>A typical workstation desktop has large areas of solid colour and of
text. Some of our most effective encodings take advantage of this by efficiently
describing rectangles consisting of one majority (background) colour and
'sub-rectangles' of different colours. There are numerous other possible
schemes.&nbsp; We might use a JPEG encoding for still images or MPEG for
efficient transmission of moving images. An encoding which uses some kind
of caching of pixel data would be good for rendering text, where the same
character is drawn in the same font multiple times. Subsequent occurrences
of the same character would be encoded simply by reference to the first
occurrence.&nbsp;
<h3>
Adaptive update protocol</h3>
A sequence of these rectangles makes a <i>framebuffer update</i> (or simply
<i>update</i>).
An update represents a change from one valid framebuffer state to another,
so in some ways is similar to a frame of video, but it is usually only
a small area of the framebuffer that will be affected by a given update.
Each rectangle may be encoded using a different scheme.&nbsp; The server
can therefore choose the best encoding for the particular screen content
being transmitted and the network bandwidth available.
<p>The update protocol is demand-driven by the client. That is, an update
is only sent by the server in response to an explicit request from the
client. This gives the protocol an adaptive quality. The slower the client
and the network are, the lower the rate of updates becomes. Each update
incorporates all the changes to the 'screen' since the last client request.
With a slow client and/or network, transient states of the framebuffer
are ignored, resulting in reduced network traffic and less drawing for
the client.&nbsp; This also improves the apparent response speed.
<h3>
Input protocol</h3>
The input side of the protocol is based on a standard workstation model
of a keyboard and multi-button pointing device. Input events are sent to
the server by the client whenever the user presses a key or pointer button,
or whenever the pointing device is moved. These input events can also be
synthesised from other non-standard I/O devices. On our <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/tile.html">Videotile</a>,
for example, a pen-based handwriting recognition engine generates keyboard
events.&nbsp;
<h3>
Connection Setup and Shutdown</h3>
When the connection between a client and a server is first established,
the server begins by requesting authentication from the client using a
challenge-response scheme, which typically results in the user being prompted
for a password at the client end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The server and client
then exchange messages to negotiate desktop size, pixel format, and the
encoding schemes to be used. The client then requests an update for the
entire screen, and the session begins.&nbsp; Because of the stateless nature
of the client, either side can close the connection at any time without
adverse consequences.
<h3>
VNC Clients</h3>
Writing an VNC viewer is a simple task, as it should be for any thin-client
system. It requires only a reliable transport (usually TCP/IP), and a way
of displaying pixels (either directly writing to the framebuffer, or going
through a windowing system).&nbsp;
<p>We have clients for all the networked display devices we have available
at our lab. This includes the <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/tile.html">Videotile</a>
(the original RFB client), an X-based client (which runs on Solaris, Linux
and Digital Unix workstations), a Win32 client which runs on Windows NT
and 95, a Macintosh client, and a Java client which runs on any Java-capable
browser (including Sun's JavaStation). Members of our lab use these clients
on a daily basis to access their personal computing environments.
<h3>
VNC Servers</h3>
Writing an VNC server is slightly harder than writing a client for a number
of reasons. The protocol is designed to make the client as simple as possible,
so it is usually up to the server to perform any necessary translations.
For example, the server must provide pixel data in the format the client
wants. We have servers for our two main platforms, X (i.e. Unix) and Windows
NT/95.&nbsp;
<p>A Unix machine can run a number of Xvnc servers for different users,
each of which represents a distinct VNC desktop. Each VNC desktop is like
a virtual X display, with a root window on which several X applications
can be displayed.&nbsp;
<p>The Windows server (WinVNC) is a little more difficult to create, because
there are fewer places to insert hooks into the system to monitor display
updates, and a less clearly-defined model of multiuser operation. Our current
server simply mirrors the real display to a remote client, which means
that the server is not 'multiuser'. It does, however, provide the primary
user of a PC with remote access to their desktop.&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="cdplay.gif" ALT="VNC CD-player" HSPACE=4 height=79 width=288 align=LEFT>We
have also created simple servers which produce displays other than desktops,
using a simple toolkit. A "VNC CD player", for example, generates a CD
player user interface using the protocol directly without any reference
to a windows system or framebuffer.&nbsp; Such servers can run on very
simple hardware, and can be accessed from any of the standard viewers.&nbsp;
