\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have described a sampling infrastructure for gathering information about
software from the set of runs produced by its user community.  To ensure
that rare events are accurately represented, we use a Bernoulli process to do the sampling,
and we have described an efficient implementation of that process.
We have also presented two sample applications: sharing the overhead of assertions, and 
using logistic regression of a large number of sampled runs to help isolate
the location of a bug.
