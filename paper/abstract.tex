We propose a sampling infrastructure for gathering information about
software from the set of runs experienced by its user community, and
show how to gather random samples with very low overhead for users.
Several example applications illustrate ways to use sampled
instrumentation to isolate bugs.  Assertion-dense code can be
transformed to share the cost of assertions among many users.  Lacking
assertions, broad guesses can be made as to crash-predictive program
behavior, and a process of elimination used to whittle these down to
the true bug.  Finally, even for non-deterministic bugs such as memory
corruption, a statistical modeling scheme based on logistic regression
allows us to identify program behaviors which are strongly correlated
with failure and where are therefore likely places to look for the
error.
