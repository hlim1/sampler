<h2>SSH-protected VNC: the case of the Windows client and the Unix server</h2>

<p><i>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/~fms/">Frank Stajano</a> for contributing this information.  
You should also read the general page on 
<A href="sshvnc.html">Making VNC more secure using SSH</a>
if you haven't already done so.</i></p>

<p>Given that SSH is such a versatile and flexible program, and given that 
port forwarding is sufficiently clever that one easily gets one's brain 
entangled trying to figure out what goes where, I thought I'd provide a 
simple step-by-step recipe for the common case in which one uses a Windows 
machine as a VNC client to a Unix desktop. I shall use the free SSH client 
provided (binaries only) by Cedomir Igaly at 
<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ci2/ssh/">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ci2/ssh/</a>
.
<font color="red">Note: It appears that Cedomir's SSH client is no longer available. We will update this document at some point, but if you read the following to get the concepts, you should be able to use the <a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html">TTSSH extension</a> to <a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html">Teraterm Pro</a>. It works very nicely.</font>
</p>

<p>The scenario is as follows: I am not at my laboratory and I am using my own 
Windows laptop, called Alice, connected as a guest machine to the network 
of the university I am visiting. My laboratory runs an SSH daemon on Unix 
machine Bob, which is connected through the lab's network to Unix machine 
Charlie, which runs my Unix VNC desktop as, say, Charlie:4. I wish to run a 
VNC client on Alice that will connect using SSH to Bob over the insecure 
wide area network, and from there without encryption to Charlie over the 
secure local area network.</p>

<p>Without any of this encryption business, the VNC client on Alice would 
connect straight to port 5904 on Charlie.</p>

<p>
<img src="alicecharlie.gif" border=0 alt="" width=445 height=107>
</p>

<p> With the encryption, it will end 
up connecting to Alice itself (localhost) on an arbitrary port, say 5954, 
which SSH will tunnel through Bob to Charlie's 5904.</p>

</p>


<p>The difficult question for the newcomer, when faced with something like the 
opening dialog box of Cedomir Igaly's SSH Windows client, is where to put 
all those machine names and port numbers: are they local or remote 
forwards? Which host goes where? Do I need one forward from Alice to Bob 
and then another from Bob to Charlie, or do I do everything in one move?</p>

<p>In the terminology of the SSH man page, what we want to do is called a 
local forward, because the fake port is created on the local host. The 
whole route from Alice to Charlie is covered in just one forward operation, 
corresponding to the two command line arguments</p>

<p><tt>    -L 5954:Charlie:5904   Bob </tt></p>

<p>The first argument is the local forwarding option which says that the local 
fake port 5954 should be created and connected to the genuine port 
Charlie:5904. The second argument is the main non-option parameter to SSH, 
which tells it the machine to which it should connect, i.e. the one that 
runs the SSH daemon.</p>

<p>As far as the Windows client is concerned, Bob goes in the "host name" 
entry field. The other three items (5954, Charlie, 5904) should be inserted 
in the dialog box that pops up when you press the "local forwards" button, 
as "local port", "host" and "remote port" respectively, making up one line 
of the "forwarded ports" listbox.</p>

<p>Having done this you should type a profile name in the main window, for 
example VNC, add your user ID (the one on Bob) in the appropriate field and 
hit save.</p>

<p>On hitting ok you will proceed to authentication. In the simple case of 
password based authentication, you just type in your Bob password and you 
get a "host is not known" window with the public key of computer Bob. At 
this point most impatient users would just hit "accept key" or "accept 
once" but you, being careful, will instead verify that it corresponds 
exactly to the one you copied from Bob's /etc/ssh_host_key.pub when you 
were still at your lab. This will safeguard you from man in the middle 
attacks where another computer pretends to be Bob. Once you are happy that 
the key being presented to you is indeed Bob's, you can click on "accept 
key", which causes the key to be recorded on Alice's known.hosts file, the 
exact location of which may be specified from the menu entry "setup/file 
locations". (Of course you could manually put the key in that file before 
even starting the client the first time, which would save you from 
performing the tedious verification; but then you would run the risk of 
getting the format wrong and so on.) Having done this once, you will never 
have to perform that verification again.</p>

<p>At that point you should have a shell connection to Bob. You can now 
iconify that and start your VNC client on Alice, pointing it at 
"localhost:54", and everything should work. Don't forget to follow the 
official advice on using VNC's hextile encoding rather than raw: raw is 
more efficient for a local (same machine) connection, so some viewers will 
choose it by default seeing that you connect to localhost; but you are not 
really on a local connection, so you should manually select hextile, which 
is more efficient for connections that go across the network.</p>

<p><i>Note that if you wish to use the Java viewer, you'll <b>also</b> need to
forward port 58xx in the same way as the 59xx examples above, because the Java applet is downloaded via ports 58xx. For the above example, you would forward port 5854 to Charlie:5804 as well as 5954 to Charlie:5904.</i></p>
