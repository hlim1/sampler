<p>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in Windows package 3.3.3r7</h3>
<p>Fixed winsock-related bug which caused R6 server not to work under unmodified Windows 95.</p>

<p>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in Windows package 3.3.3r6</h3>
<p>
The viewer has not changed in this release. The server has been upgraded to 3.3.3r6.
<h4>WinVNC server</h4>
As always, see the History.txt file in the source release for full details.  This revision incorporates:
<ul>
<li>Many bug fixes and some speed improvements (particular thanks to Will Dean)
<li>Some protection against Denial-of-Service attacks.
<li>The QuerySetting & QueryTimeout registry options which allow the user of a desktop to be prompted before others can connect.
</ul>
For details see the <a href="docs.html">WinVNC documentation</a>.
<p>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in Windows package 3.3.3r2</h3>
<p>
This package consists of version 3.3.3r2 of the server and
3.3.3r2 of the viewer.</p>
<h4>Windows VNCviewer</h4>

<p>Changed threading to fix problems on some SMP machines.</p>

<p>The <tt>-register</tt> option now stores quoted pathnames, 
so the <tt>-config</tt> option should work better when filenames have spaces in them.</p>

<p>Config files now store details about the VNC encodings selected.</p>

<p>Fixed bug which could cause a crash in rare circumstances when given an empty server name.</p>

<h4>WinVNC server</h4>

<p>Added <tt>-connect</tt> option which causes a currently running server to initiate an outgoing connection. (Equivalent of 'Add New Client' menu option.)</p>

<p>Outgoing connections are now in 'shared' mode.</p>

<p>Improved the way preferences are loaded, reducing the number of times clients will be disconnected during loading.</p>

<p>Added experimental option to disable local keyboard and mouse when remote connections active. Works on NT only.</p>

<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in Windows package 3.3.3r1</h3>
<p>
Fixed bug in the 3.3.3 server which was stopping the Java viewer from
working. This package consists of version 3.3.3r1 of the server and
3.3.3 of the viewer.</p>
 
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in Windows package 3.3.3</h3>

<p>The <a href="docs.html">documentation</a> has been updated. Please read it again if you're upgrading.</p> 
<p>The Windows VNC package is now built using Visual C++ 6.0. We recommend that you use the same or later if you wish to rebuild it from the source code.</p>

<h4>Windows VNCviewer</h4>

<p>Changes to thread scheduling and locking which should improve
reacitivity of local GUI (menus, scrollbars etc) on slow links.</p>

<p>Information about the current connection including, optionally, the
password, can be saved to a '.vnc' file, which can then be specified
on the command line.  You can use the IniFileMapping facility of NT if
you would prefer these to be saved in the registry. Also an option to
register '.vnc' files as belonging to vncviewer, so that you can
double-click on them.</p>

<p>Fairly primitive scaling facility allows you to see desktop at
different sizes.</p>

<p>In Connection dialog, display defaults to :0 if not specified, so when connecting to WinVNC servers you can usually just type the machine name.</p>

<p>Command line options to change the appearance of the local cursor.</p>

<p>3-button emulation (create a middle-button click by pressing left
and right together) is now the default, so an option has been added to
disable it if required.</p>

<p>Updated copyright notices and About... boxes.</p>

<h4>WinVNC server</h4>

<p> An 'Add New Client' option has been added to the server menu,
which initiates a connection to a listening VNC viewer (one started
with the -listen option). This allows you to send your desktop to a
helpdesk, for example, without them needing to know your password or IP address.
</p>

<p> The WinVNC settings for the currently logged in user are now
correctly loaded even when running as a service under Windows NT,
provided a small 'helper' app is run when the user logs in.  This
helper is installed automatically when WinVNC is run as a service.</p>

<p> Limited client IP-address based filtering of connections is now supported,
through the new Machine-Local registry setting "AuthHosts".</p>

<p> Incoming connections may be restricted on a server-wide basis to
being accepted only on the local-loopback interface, through the
"LoopbackOnly" registry setting.</p>

<p> Nagle's algorithm is now disabled on <i>all</i> WinVNC connections, decreasing latency considerably in many cases.</p>

<p> Dynamic priority adjustments are made to WinVNC threads to
increase performance without impacting other running applications.</p>

<p> The machine's name is now included in the title of the web page
used to access the Java version of the VNC client.</p>

<p> Timestamp information is now added in the debug log output.</p>

<p> MAJOR FIX: Two significant handle leaks which could occur when
running as a service under Windows NT have been fixed.</p>

<p> MINOR FIX: The "LockSetting" registry option is now correctly loaded.</p>

<p> MINOR FIX: A bug which would sometimes cause an Application Fault when stopping a service-mode WinVNC has been fixed.</p>

<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in windows package 3.3.2 R6</h3>
The R6 package consists of:
<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
Revision 6 of the WinVNC server</li>

<li>
Revision 11 of the Windows VNC viewer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Windows VNCviewer (R11)</h4>
Added middle-button emulation for two-button mice by clicking both buttons
simultaneously.&nbsp; This need to be turned on from the command line or
the Options dialog.&nbsp; Many thanks to Randy Brown &lt;rgb@inven.com>
for providing this very useful feature, which we've been meaning to do
for some time! A few new command line options to control this.
<p>You can start connections in full-screen mode by specifying -fullscreen
on the command line.
<p>You can disable transfer of the clipboard in both directions from the
Options dialog or the command line.
<h4>
WinVNC Server (R6)</h4>
Fixed a bug in polling of DOS-prompt boxes under Windows 95.
<p>Fixed minor protocol non-compliance bug with regard to clients which
fail to send SetPixelFormat messages.
<p>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in windows package 3.3.2 R5</h3>
See the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a> for further details. The
R5 package consists of:
<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
Revision 5 of the WinVNC server</li>

<li>
Revision 9 of the Windows VNC viewer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Windows VNCviewer (R9)</h4>
More internal restructuring so that more code can be shared with the Windows
CE viewer. Fixed some resource/handle leaks.
<p>Added a 'Request Refresh' option to the menu.
<h4>
WinVNC Server (R5)</h4>
The WinVNC registry settings have now been reorganized and improved to
allow better control over individual user's capabilities when running it,
whether as an application or as a service. Full details in the <a href="winvnc.html">documentation</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Mouse events are now produced to reflect those sent on the wire, regardless
of whether the mouse buttons would locally be swapped by the OS. This means
that left- or right-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handedness is a client-side
feature.
<p>If you hold the mouse over the WinVNC icon in the System Tray, it will
attempt to display the local IP addresses of the machine.&nbsp; Useful
if these are dynamically allocated.
<p>Some of the more important fixes:
<p>If a client chose to send multiple update requests to the server without
waiting for the update data, then the server would only consider the last
request. This behaviour was incorrect and has now been fixed. As a result,
WinVNC will now work properly with the PalmVNC viewer.
<p>The HTTP server section of WinVNC could end up listening on the wrong
port number when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automatic display number selection
was in use. This is now fixed.
<p>A small memory leak in the WinNT side of the vncService::CurrentUser
function has been fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the amount lost on
each execution was small, the function is called often enough for this
to cause problems over long periods of use.
<p>Fixed a potential lockup when the Properties dialog is closed by the
OS rather than by the Ok or Cancel buttons.
<br>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in windows package 3.3.2 R2</h3>
See the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a> for further details. The
R2 package consists of:
<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
Revision 2 of the WinVNC server</li>

<li>
Revision 5 of the Windows VNC viewer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Windows VNCviewer (R5)</h4>
Added full-screen mode. Many thanks to Greg Hewgill &lt;greg@hewgill.com>
for providing much of the basis for this.
<p>Creates a palette for much better colour on 256-colour clients.
<p>Added -viewonly and -restricted switches.
<p>In addition to Ctrl-Alt-Del, you can send individual Ctrl-up, Ctrl-down,
Alt-up and Alt-down keystrokes from the menu.
<p>Updates are not requested from the server while iconified.
<p>The initial state of the clipboard is not sent on connection as it was
in the past.
<p>Substantial source code restructuring.
<p>The local 'dot cursor' is only used when the viewer window has the focus.
<p>The modifiers are all raised when losing focus.
<p>In 'listen' mode, the tray icon is checked every 15 seconds and restored
if not there. If your Explorer dies as often as mine, you might appreciate
this.
<p>Fixed session dialog box so longer host names could be entered.
<h4>
WinVNC Server (R2)</h4>
Palette-based clients (such as the Linux SVGAlib client) are now properly
supported by WinVNC.
<p>Local-loopback connections, from viewers on the same machine as the
server, can now be enabled.
<p>Null-password connections can now be enabled.
<p>WinVNC server logging features are in place, allowing remote connections
and error conditions to be logged.
<p>More of the keypad keys are now recognised from remote clients.&nbsp;
This means that Ctrl-Alt-keypadDel will cause the server to perform the
standard Ctrl-Alt-Del procedure.
<p>Extra hook code is in place to make updates of pop-up menus, etc, work
better.
<p>The new ConnectPriority option is available, on a per-machine basis,
to indicate how the server should deal with multiple non-shared connections.
<p>Automatic display number selection is now available.
<p>The CopyRect optimisations are now better handled.
<p>Screen update notifications are now handled more efficiently.
<p>The WinVNC -kill command will now wait until any old copies of WinVNC
have quit before attempting to continue.
<br>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in 3.3.2</h3>
The MRU (most recently used) list on the viewer now works much better.&nbsp;
Extra command line options allow for more debugging output.
<p>WinVNC now returns explanatory message text to the viewer when an incoming
connection is refused because of an empty Password field or a local-loopback
connection.
<p>Mouse movements are now pre-processed by the Desktop handler and only
passed to the Client handlers immediately before an update is triggered,
resulting in less overhead and therefore lower latency.
<p>If a client requests the CopyRect encoding in the list of encodings
it supports then WinVNC will now use the CopyRect primitive when doing
simple tasks like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dragging windows. This still
has some flaws in it but generally improves performance.
<p>Updated the Java classes exported by WinVNC to include the Send-Ctrl-Alt-Del
button.
<p>Added a "-about" option, which will cause an _already running_ copy
of WinVNC to display its About box, making it easier to check that you
have the latest version!
<p>Added version information to the VNCHooks Dynamic Link Library. This
can be viewed selecting the properties dialog for the vnchooks.dll file.
<br>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in 3.3.1 Revision 19:</h3>
MS-DOS applications can now by typed into! Thanks to Gur Stavi for pointing
out that WinVNC didn't previously generate keyboard scancodes for key events.
This means that the COMMAND.COM and EDIT programs, for example, may now
be used through VNC.
<p>Lookup-table based colour translations are now incorporated into WinVNC.
This means a small increase in memory usage but delivers a noticable performance
boost on most screen formats.
<p>1, 4 and 8 bit palette-based local displays are now handled directly
by WinVNC, resulting in a significant performance boost, although there
are currently problems with the palette layout being confused in places.
<p>More intelligent culling of unchanged regions of the screen from the
list of rectangles to be sent has been implemented. Generally, this isn't
noticable but over low-bandwidth links, it should have a significant effect.
<p>WM_ENDSESSION is handled properly for full system shutdown. WM_DISPLAYCHANGE
is now handled, so that when the display resolution changes, all remote
VNC users are disconnected, to prevent corrupt display updates.
<p>The mouse cursor rendered to VNC clients is now correct most of the
time.
<p>When installing WinVNC as a service, quotes are now placed around the
executable's name, to avoid problems if there are whitespace characters
in the path. (Common because of installing to "program files\orl\vnc").
<p>The command-line options available have changed slightly - see the <a href="winvnc.html">WinVNC
documentation</a> for details.
<p>The Java viewer class files have been updated. The new classes are slightly
more compatible with borderline Java VMs.
<p>Deferred update messages are no longer removed from the application's
message queue behind its back, hopefully resulting in more reliable behaviour
&amp; fewer lock-ups.
<p>The screen-saver is now not disabled when WinVNC is running in service
mode and a connection is made, to avoid a potential race condition. This
will be handled better in a future revision.
<h4>
WIN-NT ONLY:</h4>
When running as a system service, WinVNC no longer disconnects all remote
VNC connections whenever the current desktop changes.
<p>Corrected some problems with shift-key release code confusing Windows
NT.
<h4>
WIN-95 ONLY:</h4>
WM_USERCHANGED is handled, so that when no user is logged in, the machine-local
password is used, otherwise the user's own VNC password and settings are
used. (This assumes that Windows 95 is set to Multiple User Profile mode)
<p>Under Windows 95, WinVNC running in service mode no longer crashes when
told to stop by the -kill or -remove options.
<p>The main text area of the Windows 95 console will now be polled by WinVNC
properly when the Poll Console Windows Only option is set.
<br>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in&nbsp; 3.3.1 Revision 16:</h3>
The big change is that WinVNC can now run as a service under both 95 and
NT, so you can log in and log out remotely.&nbsp; This is still under development,
so please excuse some rough edges! For more details see the <a href="winvnc.html">WinVNC
documentation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will still run in its conventional mode
if preferred.
<p>The viewer now has a 'Send Ctrl-Alt-Del' option on the menu for use
with the above. Unix viewers can generally send this anyway, as can Java
viewers on platforms which don't use it locally.
<p>A bug which often caused the entire screen to be transmitted twice to
a connecting client is now fixed.
<p>The general Shift, Alt and Control-related bugs, affecting non-UK/US
keyboard layouts in particular, are now corrected, with one important exception:
<p>When typing into an application set to use international keyboard layout
A, using WinVNC run with keyboard layout B, problems may be experienced
because WinVNC sets the wrong Shift key states to generate particular characters.
As long as only one keyboard layout is used consistently across all applications,
this shouldn't be a problem.
<p>The viewer now generates AltGr international characters according to
the keyboard layout in use. The right Ctrl key can be combined with these
so that on a German keyboard, for example, AltGr-Q gives @ and RightCtrl-AltGr-Q
gives Ctrl-@.&nbsp; Dead keys are not properly supported yet.
<br>
<hr color="#000080" noshade>
<h3>
New in&nbsp; 3.3.1 Revision 13:</h3>
The Caps-Lock, Num-Lock and Scroll-Lock keys are now correctly disabled
whenever a new client connects, if that client has keyboard input enabled.
<p>Left and right versions of the Shift, Alt and Control keys can now be
distinguished on NT if the viewer distinguishes.
<p>The right and middle mouse buttons can now be set to trigger window
updates, although by default these options are not used. This can be handy
for things which use right-click for something other than popping up a
menu.</td>
