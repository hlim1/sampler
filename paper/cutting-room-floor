These heuristics preclude us from identifying certain types of errors,
such as forgotten initialization bugs.  If a program only crashes when
it fails to run some initialization code, \elim{lack of failing
  coverage} will observe that the initialization code is not used on
crashing runs, and therefore conclude that this cannot be the cause of
the bug.  Any attempt to identify crashes caused by code that did
\emph{not} run is just as likely to seize upon the \texttt{return}
statement at the end of \texttt{main()}: this is a statement that is
consistently reached by successful runs but not reached by runs that
crash.  Yet reporting that the program crashed because it failed to
return from \texttt{main()} is hardly useful.  A more refined
treatment of code with differing roles may be required in order to
capture this class of bugs.
