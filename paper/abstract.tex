We propose a sampling infrastructure for gathering information about
software from the set of runs experienced by its user community.  We
show how to gather samples with very low overhead for users, and also
show how to make use of the information we gather.  We present two
sample applications: sharing the overhead of assertions, and 
using analysis of a large number of sampled runs to help isolate
the location of a bug.
