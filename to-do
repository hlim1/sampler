* tray

Use ORBit_small_{,un}listen_for_broken() to clean up after dead
clients.

* wrapper

The last client to call monitor.unref() sometimes gets a
CORBA.COMM_FAILURE exception.  Not sure why.  We work around it by
catching and discarding the exception, but that's not a real fix.

Server reply dialog has bad tab navigation.  If focus is on a
hyperlink in the HTML area, you cannot tab out to the "OK" button.

How does wrapper propagate SIGINT (^C) down to child?  Restore temporary
passing of SIGINT down, even thought it is less than perfect.

Add some sort of upper bound on upload lengths to prevent things from
getting completely out of hand if the instrumented application gets
into a bad loop.

For long-lived processes, perhaps we need to send periodic interim
reports (e.g. daily) instead of waiting for termination.  This will
require support from the client application too, though.

* packaging

Consider adding some sort of "README.sampler" to the documentation for
each sampled application RPM.

* instrumentor

** general

Change List.map to List.rev_map in cases where the order doesn't
matter.

Document --{no-,}assume-weightless-{libraries,externs} and hook them
up in the Perl driver.

Remember which functions are loopless.  Use this to optimize treatment
of calls to known loopless functions.

instrumentor/logging/loads/tests/multiple is incorrectly printing a
single value multiple times

assume that anything declared in /usr/include/... or
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... or perhaps a few other places is library code

** CFG embedding

instruction isolation only needs to happen once

cfg building might not need to be called as often

Dynamic.analyze might not need to be called as often

Add extraction support to rpmbuild script, similar to what we
currently do for site descriptions.
