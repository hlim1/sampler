* sampler-0.5.5

** Embed the name of the instrumentation scheme as an ident string.
We want to be able to ask an executable what kind of instrumentation
it has.

** Let C compiler merge identical ident strings used to record
instrumentor configuration.  We don't mind the aliasing and it makes
executables smaller.

* sampler-0.5.4

** Correct a typo in the first-time opt-in dialog.

* sampler-0.5.3

** Add instrumentor driver support for GCC "-gLEVEL" debug flags.

* sampler-0.5.1, sampler-0.5.2

** Internal updates only.  No significant user-visible changes.

* sampler-0.5

** Split preferences out into stand-alone control panel applet (capplet).

** Faster application startup.  Activate the notification area monitor
   only *after* the instrumented application has been launched.

* sampler-0.4.4, sampler-0.4.5

** Assorted bug fixes

* sampler-0.4.3

** Fix several bugs in server reply handling (rarely used).

* sampler-0.4.2

** Add missing file required for first-time dialog.  (All sampling is
   disabled as a failsafe until first time dialog has been run.)
