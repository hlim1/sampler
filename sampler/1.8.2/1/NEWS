These are all intended for use with the "Performance and Optimization"
section of my dissertation.  They are of little interest to the
typical developer and of no interest to end users.

   by default, though, as I want to test it more before rolling it out
   for general use.

   more reliable source file linking later.  Updated RPM packaging
   tools remap these absolute names to point to the sources bundled up
   in the corresponding "*-debuginfo" package.

* sampler-0.10

** Add ability to timestamp instrumentation sites either when first
   observed or when last observed.  Not yet documented, unfortunately.

** Add build distribution field to feedback reports.  This is not the
   user's distribution; it is just the distribution against which the
   package was originally built.  This helps me distinguish reports
   for the same software release on multiple platforms.
