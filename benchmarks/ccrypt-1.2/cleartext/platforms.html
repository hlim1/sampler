<p>VNC is available for many platforms beyond just the ones we use at
our lab. On this page you will find information about a huge number of
other operating systems and environments for which at least some part
of VNC has been ported.  Sometimes there are links to other web sites,
often with binaries available. In other cases you'll find details
about how to modify the standard source code to get it to compile. </p>

<p>We prefer not to distribute binaries directly from our web site for
platforms we cannot test here, but we are happy to put links to sites
which do, and we are grateful to all the contributors. If you port VNC

<p>For anyone trying to build the latest version of VNC under AIX 4.1.5
may be interested in the patch below which contains the quick and dirty
changes I needed to do to be able to comple and link successfully (hopefully
I didn't miss anything). Things went pretty smoothly after these minor
changes and it seems to be running fine.Basically the patch adds the necessary
AIX sys/select.h inclusion where needed, removes the X11R6 specific stuff,
and forces sys/resource.h to be included. That last one left me sort of
puzzled,as the way it was trying to build should have not tried including
it at all (which should have been fine), but it looked like os/osinit.c
WASN'T including it while os/utils.c WAS for some unknown reason (andthe
#if logic looked correct to me in both files) creating undefinedsymbols.

<p><i>Karl Hakimian &lt;<a href="mailto:hakimian@aha.com">hakimian@aha.com</a>>
wrote about his experiences building 3.3.2:</i>
<p>HPUX did not go as smoothly as some of the other OS's that have been
reported, but I did manage to get things to compile under hpux 10.20.
<p>First I had to change Xvnc/config/cf/hp.cf
<p>Same as for 3.3.1, I made sure the following were set
<p><tt>#define ExtensionOSDefines -DHPINPUT # -DXTESTEXT1</tt>
<br><tt>#define XhpServer NO</tt>
<br><tt>#define BuildXInputExt NO</tt>
<p><tt>#define BuildPex NO</tt>
<br><tt>#define BuildPexExt NO</tt>
<br><tt>#define XvncServer YES</tt>
<p>I also had to change the following to NO
<br><tt>#define NeedBerklib NO</tt>
<p>That got things most of the way compiled. I then could not link Xvnc
becuase of several missing objects
<p><tt>limitNoFile</tt>
<br><tt>limitDataSpace</tt>
<br><tt>limitStackSpace</tt>
<p>Turns out I just needed to include sys/resource.h to two files in the
programs/Xserver/os directory, the following patch takes care of that.

<p>Just to inform you I've managed to build the vnc suite on the following
HP box HP-UX &lt;name> B.10.20 E 9000/879
<p>I had major problems trying to build it with the standard HP tools and
after much head banging and source editing, I decided to forget it and
switch to gcc which worked after about the 3'rd build. I applied the patches
as advised in the contrib section on your site.
<p>The only further problem I had was getting the Xvnc server to recognize
the correct fonts - somehow the aliasing config here seems a bit odd, so
to get around that problem I just ran the x font server and it solved all
the problems.
<p><i>And Ulrik Dickow &lt;ukd@kampsax.dk> adds:</i>
<p>This evening I succesfully built vnc-3.3.2r3 on HP/UX 10.20 9000/712
with the
<br>HP ANSI C compiler.&nbsp; I first na&iuml;vely tried
<p>&nbsp; xmkmf
<br>&nbsp; make World
<br>&nbsp; cd Xvnc
<br>&nbsp; make World
<p>without any modifications to the source files, but this gave lots of
errors
<br>in the Xvnc compilation.&nbsp; Then I changed hp.cf with Karls modifications
from
<br>vnc/platforms.html and changed the two C files that his "short patch"
<br>mentions (but in a slightly improved way).&nbsp; This compiled succesfully,
with
<br>only harmless warnings.&nbsp; To make it easier for others to build
on HP/UX 10,
<br>I've attached the resulting "jumbo patch" to this mail.
<p>It would be even easier if the changes were permanently done to the
master
<br>source.&nbsp; They don't affect other platforms than HP/UX, and I guess
they'll
<br>help HP/UX 9 and 11 users too, won't they?
<p>To complete the help for fellow HP/UX'ers, the second attached patch
modifies
<br>a few lines of the vncserver Perl script to
<p>&nbsp; a) start a CDE session if possible, otherwise fall back to the
old code
<p>&nbsp; b) set the `-fp' argument reasonably for HP/UX (the CDE script
will add
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more to this path).
<p>Due to b), the second patch should *not* be applied to the general
<br>distribution, although a) might be.
<p>If somebody have problems with these plaintext unified diffs, I can
provide
<br>context diffs instead, possibly in base64 or uuencoded form.&nbsp;
I start out
<br>with unified diffs, since they are much shorter and much more readable
in
<br>this case.&nbsp; Apply them in the top vnc source directory like this:
<p>&nbsp; patch -p1 &lt; vnc-3.3.2r3_unix.ukd-kh-hpux-patch
<br>&nbsp; patch -p1 &lt; vnc-3.3.2r3_unix.ukd-hpux_specific-patch.txt
<p>Long live GNU patch(1) (http://www.gnu.org/).
<p>Thanks to ORL for conceiving a great product, and to Karl for finding
out how
<br>to compile it on HP/UX 10.&nbsp; BTW, I compiled on a machine with
these bundles
<br>installed, as part of an upgrade from 9.0x:
<p>&nbsp; B3393AA_APZ B.10.20.02 HP-UX Developer's Toolkit for 10.0 Series
700&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp; B3898AA_APZ B.10.20.02 HP C/ANSI C Developer's Bundle for HP-UX

<h3>OpenBSD</h3> 

<i>Jonathan Schneider
&lt;jschneider@cix.compulink.co.uk&gt; writes that he has built VNC
successfully under OpenBSD 2.5 on both i386 and sparc by doing little
more than creating a symbolic link from /usr/lib/X11 to
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11. Either GNU make or BSD make will work. He needed a 'make -k' to get around the fact that there is no 'vncviewer.man' provided. He writes:</i>

<p>I've a slight gripe in that on the IPX at least, "make install" puts loads 
of stuff into /usr/lib/X11/config* which already existed in 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config. I imagine that's desirable if there isn't 
already an X server installation but scary if there is (and it had used 
the correct directory).</p>

OpenStep/Mach</h3>
<i>David Young <a href="mailto:(dwy@picasso.eng.ace.net">(dwy@picasso.eng.ace.net</a>)
writes:</i>
<p>I've written a client for OPENSTEP/Mach (that spiffy NeXT OS) for VNC.
<p>It currently supports display at 24, 12, and 8 bpp, mouse and mostly-functional
keyboard input (ASCII and control characters work; the mapping isn't yet
complete and I'm looking for suggestions on how to complete it), and some
other client-side niceties. Encodings other than raw are on their way,
as is NSPasteboard integration.
<p>I'm looking for users (preferably with VNC and OPENSTEP experience)
who can bang on this client on original NeXT boxes, Intel machines, or
SPARCstations running OPENSTEP 4.2, or just people who might find it useful
at this early state.

<p>I compiled the unix [3.3.1] sources with the attached diffs and got
a working viewer under OS2 with XFree86 (and EMX).

problems with National characters for the win server otherwise it works
fine.

<h3>
OSF</h3>
<i>We used to have DEC Alpha OSF machines here, but they've all been switched off now, so we're unlikely to distribute any binaries for any more recent versions of VNC. 
Nirav Merchant <a href="mailto:nirav@arl.arizona.edu">nirav@arl.arizona.edu</a> has made binaries for OSF 3.3.3 available. He writes: </i>

<p>I have put the OSF binaries, java classes along with the original
copyright at:</p> 

<p><a href="ftp://public.arl.arizona.edu/pub/sware/vnc-current_osf.tgz">ftp://public.arl.arizona.edu/pub/sware/vnc-current_osf.tgz</a></p>

<p>Should work fine with Digital UNIX 4.0. </p>
        
<p>Since we will be using OSF, I will make sure that the lastest version of
VNC OSF binaries are available at this URL.</p>

<h3>RedHat Linux 6.0</h3>
<p>If you have difficulties running vncserver on RH6, check at least the following:
<ul>
<li>Install the 100dpi fonts from the RedHat distribution if not already installed.</li>
<li>Check the font path in the vncserver script.</li>
<li>Check the permissions on /tmp/.X11-unix as mentioned in the FAQ under 'Why can I only run Xvnc as root?'.</li>

SPARC Linux</h3>
<i>James Hall &lt;jhall1@isd.net> writes:</i>
<p>Just thought I would let you know: VNC 3.3.2r2 compiles just fine on
Linux/SPARC. I am using it now to run Word and Lotus Notes without
<br>having to go back to my office and use my Windows 95 PC.
<p>To compile, I just ran the 'configure' script, then typed 'make'.&nbsp;
I think I got a few warnings during the compile (mostly unused variables)
but VNC runs fine.&nbsp; This was on Red Hat Linux/SPARC 4.x, so I didn't
have glibc. Don't know if that makes a difference.

<i>Shinji Hattori <shattori@icg.tnr.sharp.co.jp> writes:</i></p>
<p>I could not find a VNC package for Sparc Linux.
So I made small patch and compiled on Redhat 5.2 sparc.
Xvnc works fine.

<h3>
SVGALIB (Linux without an X server) &amp; Single-floppy Linux</h3>

<p><i>One of the very first VNC viewer ports was done by Ganesh
Varadarajan and Sitaram Iyer.  They built a vncviewer which runs
directly from a Linux console using the <a
href="http://www.svgalib.org">SVGALIB</a> library.&nbsp; You will need
to install svgalib and configure /etc/vga/libvga.config for your
graphics card.  This can be a bit fiddly - the vgatest program which
comes with the svgalib distribution can sometimes help, and check the
setup using another svgalib program such as zgv if you have problems
with the viewer.</i></p>

<p><i>The viewer doesn't do any scaling or scrolling, so the desktop you connect to must be of a resolution supported by your SVGALIB setup. Try creating servers of different geometries and
connecting to them - if your svgalib setup doesn't work for one
resolution it may work for another.&nbsp; Persevere - this has a lot
of potential.  You can use it to make a very lightweight graphics terminal with reasonable performance on low-end hardware.</i></p>
 
<p><i>The current version will not generally be able to connect to
Windows servers, because it requests a palette-based display which the
Windows server cannot generate.</i></p>

<p><i>The sources for svncviewer are here: <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/contrib/svnc-0.1.tgz">svnc-0.1.tgz</a>&nbsp;
Remember that you will need both X and the VNC sources on your machine
to build it, though you won't need them to run it!</i>

<h4>Single-floppy Linux</h4>
<i>Karl Heinz Kremer <a href="mailto:khk@cyberdude.com">khk@cyberdude.com</a>
has created a single-floppy linux distribution which includes svncviewer.&nbsp;
You can now use an old 486 without even a hard disk as an X display. See
<a href="http://www.khk.net/">http://www.khk.net</a>
for details</i>

VMS</h3>
VNC viewers for VMS 7.1 on both Vax an Alpha are available on the Law Bulletin
Publishing Company's FTP server.&nbsp; Se the entry below for Windows NT/Alpha,
and note the point about using a normal FTP client and not a browser.

<h3>
Windows CE</h3>
The Windows CE viewer is now released! See the <a href="download.html">Download
Page</a> and the <a href="docs.html">Documentation</a>. We don't currently have the compiler to build for the ARM platform, so if you have an HP Jornada or similar you may want to get a binary from <A HREF="http://www.conduits.com/ce">http://www.conduits.com/ce</A>.

<p>Binaries and VC++ project files are now available for Alpha NT WinVNC3.3.2.
You can download them from: <a href="ftp://ftp.lawbulletin.com/vnc/">ftp://ftp.lawbulletin.com/vnc/</a>
You will probably have better luck downloading with a standard FTP client
instead of using a web browser (it's a firewall issue). We plan to upgrade
soon, but until then, the old-fashioned way works best.</td>
