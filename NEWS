* sampler-0.14.1

** Fix duplicate symbol errors in bounds scheme.
** Avoid several GCC warnings.
** Assorted timestamp bug fixes.

* sampler-0.14

** Ignore program constants in excluded files.
** Install ".desktop" icon along proper search path.
** Improved workaround for Glade GnomeHRef label bug.

* sampler-0.13.1

** Put architecture back into build distribution upload header.

* sampler-0.13

** Add support for tweaking various optimizations.

These are all intended for use with the "Performance and Optimization"
section of my dissertation.  They are of little interest to the
typical developer and of no interest to end users.

* sampler-0.12.4

** Continued small packaging tweaks.

* sampler-0.12.3

** Various makefile tweaks for cleaner packaging.

* sampler-0.12.2

** If the first-time dialog is dismissed using the window manager
   instead of the [OK] button, ask again next time.

* sampler-0.12.1

** More work on multiple wrapped executables in a single package.

* sampler-0.12

** Improved developer documentation.

** Reorganize "/usr/lib/sampler/applications" to allow multiple
   wrapped executables in a single package.

* sampler-0.11

** Implemented path balancing to make fast path even faster.  Disabled
   by default, though, as I want to test it more before rolling it out
   for general use.

** Store absolute file names in static site information and CFG for
   more reliable source file linking later.  Updated RPM packaging
   tools remap these absolute names to point to the sources bundled up
   in the corresponding "*-debuginfo" package.

** Minor bug fixes to developer tools.

* sampler-0.10

** Add ability to timestamp instrumentation sites either when first
   observed or when last observed.  Not yet documented, unfortunately.

** Add build distribution field to feedback reports.  This is not the
   user's distribution; it is just the distribution against which the
   package was originally built.  This helps me distinguish reports
   for the same software release on multiple platforms.

* sampler-0.9.1

** Minor bug fixes to developer tools.

** Add experimental "--without-gnome" configure script flag to
   suppress building of GNOME-dependent client GUI tools.

* sampler-0.9

** New "g-object-unref" instrumentation scheme tracks state of GLib
   Object System instances that are about to be unreferenced.

* sampler-0.8

** Important atomicity bug fix for multithreaded applications.

** Minor bug fixes to developer tools.

** Improved support for multiple schemes in developer tools.

* sampler-0.7.3

** Minor bug fixes in feedback analysis tools.

** Extend copyright notices into 2004.

* sampler-0.7.2

** Merge Fedora Core 1 port branch back onto trunk

** Various and sundry bug fixes.

* sampler-0.7.1

** Back-port the instrumentor to OCaml-3.06.

** Omit GNOME-based client tools if "pkg-config" is missing.

* sampler-0.7

** Support multiple active schemes within a single binary.

* sampler-0.6.1

** Don't upload empty report if instrumented app died suddenly.
   This should fix the "Malformed multipart POST" error reported by
   some users.

** Embed instrumentor version number in instrumented object files.

* sampler-0.6

** Internal bug fixes to report reader/writer pipe management.

** Extract global control flow / call graphs from instrumented code.
   Supports certain experimental analyses which are still under
   development.

* sampler-0.5.6

** Driver bug fixes when running out of build tree.

* sampler-0.5.5

** Minor ident string improvements.

* sampler-0.5.4

** Correct a typo in the first-time opt-in dialog.

* sampler-0.5.3

** Add instrumentor driver support for GCC "-gLEVEL" debug flags.

* sampler-0.5.1, sampler-0.5.2

** Internal updates only.  No significant user-visible changes.

* sampler-0.5

** Split preferences out into stand-alone control panel applet (capplet).

** Faster application startup.  Activate the notification area monitor
   only *after* the instrumented application has been launched.

* sampler-0.4.4, sampler-0.4.5

** Assorted bug fixes

* sampler-0.4.3

** Fix several bugs in server reply handling (rarely used).

* sampler-0.4.2

** Add missing file required for first-time dialog.  (All sampling is
   disabled as a failsafe until first time dialog has been run.)
