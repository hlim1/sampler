* sampler-0.10

** Add ability to timestamp instrumentation sites either when first
   observed or when last observed.  Not yet documented, unfortunately.

** Add build distribution field to feedback reports.  This is not the
   user's distribution; it is just the distribution against which the
   package was originally built.  This helps me distinguish reports
   for the same software release on multiple platforms.

* sampler-0.9.1

** Minor bug fixes to developer tools.

** Add experimental "--without-gnome" configure script flag to
   suppress building of GNOME-dependent client GUI tools.

* sampler-0.9

** New "g-object-unref" instrumentation scheme tracks state of GLib
   Object System instances that are about to be unreferenced.

** Improved support for multiple schemes in developer tools.

* sampler-0.7.3

* sampler-0.7

   some users.

** Embed instrumentor version number in instrumented object files.

   development.
