<h2>
<b>Want to help?&nbsp; - Project suggestions</b></h2>
One of the reasons we've made the source code available was so that people
could modify and improve it, port it to new platforms, create new software
using VNC, and so forth.&nbsp; Most of the contributions so far have been
ports to new platforms; see the <a href="contribs.html">contribs</a> page
for details.
<p>Here are some things that we think would be worth doing.&nbsp; If you
would like to sign up to work on any of these, or if you have any new suggestions,
please let us know.&nbsp; We'll start with the most important:
<h3>
Improving WinVNC</h3>
If you've used both the X server (Xvnc) and the Windows server (WinVNC)
you will notice that the Windows one is considerably slower.&nbsp; There
is a simple reason for this.&nbsp; We have the source code for X, and we
know exactly what it is doing.&nbsp; With Windows, we can get hints by
inserting system hooks to monitor messages, but they're only hints and
not all applications use suitable messages, so we often have to poll areas
of the screen just to see if anything has changed.&nbsp; The two main alternative
approaches would be:
<ul>writing a pseudo-video driver, which could notify WinVNC with more
precise details
<p>writing a wrapper around the GDI DLLs which would hook into all screen
updates at that level</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>

VNC uses a single TCP/IP connection, so a version which runs over Secure
Sockets should be easy to build.&nbsp; Some users have reported that wrapping
the connection using SSH works well and gives you compression as well.
See the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for details.&nbsp; But it would be nice
to have it built-in, not least because SSH for Windows is not free.
<p>People have built the viewer to allow access outward through SOCKS firewalls.
See the <a href="contribs.html">contribs</a> page.

<h3>Compression</h3>

The VNC protocol is fairly efficient in the way it transmits areas of the
screen, but on slow networks a generic compression system would be worth
incorporating.&nbsp;&nbsp; The important requirements are:
<ul>It should be possible to switch it off, so that it doesn't increase
latency on fast networks.&nbsp; This would probably mean adding an extra
message to the VNC protocol.
<p>The compression code needs to be easily portable to all platforms including
Java.
<p>The code needs to be freely distributable under the GPL.</ul>

<h3>Single-application servers</h3>

A VNC server doesn't have to be a desktop.&nbsp; In many circumstances
it can be useful for a single application to be a VNC server; we've done
a CD player, for example, that can be controlled by anyone in the room.
It would be good to have a simple toolkit to do this - perhaps the Java
Swing toolkit could be extended so that the graphic context object used
for drawing operations could be a VNC server as well...&nbsp;
<p>Steve Cheng has written a GGI 'target' which allows programs using libGGI
to become VNC servers - see the <a href="contribs.html">contribs</a> page
for details.
<p>You can also get the source code for possibly the most basic VNC server
we've written - <a href="rfbcounter.html">rfbcounter</a>.

<h3>Attaching to a running X server</h3>

As mentioned in the FAQ, the X-based VNC server appears as a separate
display for your applications (typically :1).  In theory it would be
possible to attach VNC code to a standard X server so that the
applications on the main screen were accessible by VNC, though with
many Unix platforms only the binary of the X server is shipped, making
this more tricky.  With XFree86 4.0, it should be rather easier. There
is some discussion about this on the mailing list <a
href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/archives/2000-03/0228.html">here</a>.

<h3>Other platforms</h3>

One of our catch-phrases for VNC is <i>"Any-to-Any"</i>; the basic aim
being to access any user interface from any other user interface. There
are several platforms it would be good to support, but that we can't do
here. We used to list several Unix platforms here but since the release
of VNC others have ported it to HP-UX, SGI,. AIX, FreeBSD and SunOS 4 amongst
others -&nbsp; see the <a href="contribs.html">contribs</a> page for details.
<p>How about a Windows 3.1 client?&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Win32 viewer
is multi-threaded, but if that aspect were removed it shouldn't be too
hard to build for 3.1.
<p>If you have either a client or server running on any new platforms,
we'd like to hear about it. Remember that you should be able to run a viewer
on any platform which supports Java...

<h3>Record and Playback</h3>

Proxies which do things like recording a session for later playback,
extra compression, scaling, access control, etc are not difficult to
create, though you need to keep the latency low. There has been some
work on this - try searching the mailing lists for 'proxy' or
'rfbproxy'.

<h3>Other network transports</h3>

At the moment VNC uses TCP/IP for the connection between viewer and server,
but that's purely for convenience. It could just as well run over Firewire,
USB, RS232, modems and ISDN lines without IP being there at all.&nbsp;
A modem link would be very handy particularly for remote maintenance; you
could dial up PCs which did not necessarily have an IP address.&nbsp;
<p>We don't, at present, support simple dialup without TCP, for example,
because it involves writing a lot of code to talk to the modem, which would
take more time than we have available at present, and would also expand
dramatically the otherwise slim viewer and server.&nbsp; The right way
to do this is probably to provide a scripting extension, so that the dialup
code could be external and easily customised.
