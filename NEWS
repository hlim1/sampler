** Fix nasty line buffering bug in report reader.

* sampler-1.1.1

** Fix empty applications list in sampler-preferences dialog.

* sampler-1.1

** Use unsigned 64-bit integers for timestamps to forestall overflow.
** Various minor updates to project packaging and metadata.
** Updates to experimental points-to analysis at indirect calls.

* sampler-0.13.1

** Put architecture back into build distribution upload header.

* sampler-0.13

** Add support for tweaking various optimizations.

These are all intended for use with the "Performance and Optimization"
section of my dissertation.  They are of little interest to the
typical developer and of no interest to end users.

* sampler-0.12.4

** Continued small packaging tweaks.

* sampler-0.12.3

** Various makefile tweaks for cleaner packaging.

* sampler-0.12.2

** If the first-time dialog is dismissed using the window manager
   instead of the [OK] button, ask again next time.

** More work on multiple wrapped executables in a single package.

* sampler-0.12

** Improved developer documentation.

** Reorganize "/usr/lib/sampler/applications" to allow multiple
   wrapped executables in a single package.

* sampler-0.11

** Implemented path balancing to make fast path even faster.  Disabled
   by default, though, as I want to test it more before rolling it out
   for general use.

** Store absolute file names in static site information and CFG for
   more reliable source file linking later.  Updated RPM packaging
   tools remap these absolute names to point to the sources bundled up
   in the corresponding "*-debuginfo" package.

** Minor bug fixes to developer tools.

* sampler-0.10

** Add ability to timestamp instrumentation sites either when first
   observed or when last observed.  Not yet documented, unfortunately.

** Add build distribution field to feedback reports.  This is not the
   user's distribution; it is just the distribution against which the
   package was originally built.  This helps me distinguish reports
   for the same software release on multiple platforms.

* sampler-0.9.1

** Minor bug fixes to developer tools.

** Add experimental "--without-gnome" configure script flag to
   suppress building of GNOME-dependent client GUI tools.

   some users.

   development.
