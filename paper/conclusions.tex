\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have described a sampling infrastructure for gathering information
about software from the set of runs produced by its user community.
To ensure that rare events are accurately represented, we use a
Bernoulli process to do the sampling, and we have described an
efficient implementation of that process.  We have also presented
several sample applications: sharing the overhead of assertions,
predicate guessing and elimination to isolate a deterministic bug, and
regularized logistic regression to isolate a non-deterministic memory
corruption error.
