      <summary>Seen the first-time opt-in dialog</summary>
      <description>Set to true once the user has seen and responded to the first-time opt-in dialog.  If changed back to false, the first-time opt-in dialog will be presented again the next time an instrumented application runs.</description>

      <summary>Sampling and reporting is enabled</summary>
      <description>Set to true if the user has decided to participate in the bug isolation project: samples will be collected during each run and reported to the central bug isolation server after each run concludes.  Set to false if the user has decided not to participate: no samples will be collected or reported.  Note that if the sibling “asked” key is false, then this key only sets the default for the first-time opt-in dialog.  Sampling only begins once both “asked” and “enabled” are true.</description>
